1,Percy Faith,Theme From “A Summer Place”,1960,"There's a summer place Where it may rain or storm Yet I'm safe and warm For within that summer place Your arms reach out to me And my heart is free from all care For it knows  There are no gloomy skies When seen through the eyes Of those who are blessed with love  And the sweet secret of A summer place Is that it's anywhere When two people share All their hopes All their dreams All their love  And the sweet secret of a summer place Is that it's anywhere When two people share All their hopes All their dreams, all their love"
